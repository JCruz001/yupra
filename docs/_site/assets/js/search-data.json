    "content": "Note: If you have not installed the packages vplanet and vplanet_inference you first need to install these. Import packages: . import vplanet import subprocess import numpy as np from astropy import units as u import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import rcParams rcParams['font.family'] = 'stixgeneral' rcParams['text.usetex'] = False rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 16 rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 16 rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 16 # Create a directory to store our simulation configuration files import os temp_dir = \"infile_templates\" if not os.path.exists(temp_dir): os.mkdir(temp_dir) . 1. Setting up infile templates . VPLANET operates using infiles which specify all of the parameters settings used in your simulation. For the case of modeling the stellar evolution of an individual star, we will have two files: . | vpl file vpl.in - configurations for the system (including numerical integration settings, output options, units, as well as system age) | body file star.in - represents the star, sets the stellar parameters, and specifies which stellar models are used for stellar evolution (also magnetic braking, not shown in this case) | . To run VPLANET in python we’ll copy these infiles to strings here (I’ve added some annotations for each of the variables): . # System input file template vpl_file = \"\"\"# sSystemName system iVerbose 0 # Verbosity level bOverwrite 1 # Allow file overwrites? saBodyFiles star.in # list infile names of all body files bDoLog 1 # Write a log file? iDigits 6 # Maximum number of digits to right of decimal dMinValue 1e-10 # Minimum value of eccentricity/obliquity bDoForward 1 # Perform a forward evolution? bVarDt 1 # Use variable timestepping? dEta 0.01 # Coefficient for variable timestepping # Input/Output Units # Units specified in the primary input file are propagated into the bodies sUnitMass solar # Options: gram, kg, Earth, Neptune, Jupiter, solar sUnitLength m # Options: cm, m, km, Earth, Jupiter, solar, AU sUnitTime year # Options: sec, day, year, Myr, Gyr sUnitAngle deg # Options: deg, rad dStopTime 1.0e9 # Final age which the system will be evolved to [sUnitTime] dOutputTime 1.0e6 # Output timesteps (finer timesteps will take longer) [sUnitTime] \"\"\" # Star input file template body_file = \"\"\"# sName star # body name saModules stellar # VPLanet module(s) used sStellarModel baraffe # stellar model grid (currently only baraffe+2015 grids) dMass 1.0 # stellar mass [sUnitMass] dAge 5e6 # age at which stellar grids are initialized (age we assume star has formed) [sUnitTime] # output evolution parameters saOutputOrder Time Luminosity Radius Temperature \"\"\" . Now let’s save these infiles to our folder infile_templates/stellar/baraffe: . # Create subdirectory stellar/baraffe to save this example example_baraffe = os.path.join(temp_dir, \"stellar/baraffe\") if not os.path.exists(example_baraffe): os.makedirs(example_baraffe) # Write vpl_file to vpl.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe, \"vpl.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(vpl_file, file=file) # Write body_file to star.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe, \"star.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(body_file, file=file) . 2. Running simulations through command line . This model can be run through command line by executing vplanet vpl.in in the directory where we saved the infiles: . subprocess.call(\"vplanet vpl.in\", cwd=example_baraffe, shell=True) . Plotting results: In our body file we specified that we wanted vplanet to track the evolution of the following parameters: . saOutputOrder Time Luminosity Radius Temperature . We can make a quick plot of these output variables using the auto_plot function of the package vplot: . import vplot as vpl vpl.auto_plot(example_baraffe) . We can retrieve and manipulate the outputs using the vplanet function get_output. The returned arrays will be in the same order as we specified in the saOutputOrder of our body file (star.in) . output = vplanet.get_output(example_baraffe) output.star[:] . We can convert the units of our output arrays using astropy units, for example: . sim_time = output.star[:][0].to(u.yr) sim_luminosity = output.star[:][1].to(u.Lsun) . plt.plot(sim_time, sim_luminosity) plt.ylabel(\"Luminosity [Lsun]\") plt.xlabel(\"Time [yr]\") plt.xscale(\"log\") plt.yscale(\"log\") plt.show() . 3. How to add input variables and output variables . [Part A] say we also want to model the XUV luminosity of our star. vplanet includes the Ribas+2005 empirical model for XUV evolution of low-mass, which is parameterized by a broken power law: \\begin{align} \\frac{L_{\\rm XUV}}{L_{\\rm bol}} = \\left{ \\begin{array}{lcr} f_\\mathrm{sat} &amp;\\ &amp; t \\leq t_\\mathrm{sat} f_\\mathrm{sat}\\left(\\frac{t}{t_\\mathrm{sat}}\\right)^{-\\beta_\\mathrm{XUV}} &amp;\\ &amp; t &gt; t_\\mathrm{sat} \\end{array} \\right. \\end{align} This model assumes that young (more active) stars exhibit a “saturated” level of XUV luminosity relative to bolometric (total luminosity), which then decays exponentially over time, after a “saturation time”. Here $L_{\\rm bol}$ is the bolometric luminosity [$L_\\odot$], $L_{\\rm XUV}$ is the XUV luminosity [$L_\\odot$], $f_\\mathrm{sat} = \\log_{10}(L_{\\rm XUV}/L_{\\rm bol})$ is the saturation ratio, $t_\\mathrm{sat}$ is the duration of saturation phase [Gyr], $\\beta_\\mathrm{XUV}$ is the exponential decay rate of $L_{\\rm XUV}$ after saturation, and $t$ is the evolution time [Gyr]. To have vplanet compute the XUV lumiosity evolution using this model, we’ll add the following input variables to our body infiles (since they are properties of the star, they will go in star.in): . dSatXUVFrac dSatXUVTime dXUVBeta . And we will also add the following variable to our output variables in saOutputOrder: . LXUVTot . # System input file template vpl_file = \"\"\"# sSystemName system iVerbose 0 # Verbosity level bOverwrite 1 # Allow file overwrites? saBodyFiles star.in # list infile names of all body files bDoLog 1 # Write a log file? iDigits 6 # Maximum number of digits to right of decimal dMinValue 1e-10 # Minimum value of eccentricity/obliquity bDoForward 1 # Perform a forward evolution? bVarDt 1 # Use variable timestepping? dEta 0.01 # Coefficient for variable timestepping # Input/Output Units # Units specified in the primary input file are propagated into the bodies sUnitMass solar # Options: gram, kg, Earth, Neptune, Jupiter, solar sUnitLength m # Options: cm, m, km, Earth, Jupiter, solar, AU sUnitTime year # Options: sec, day, year, Myr, Gyr sUnitAngle deg # Options: deg, rad dStopTime 1.0e9 # Final age which the system will be evolved to [sUnitTime] dOutputTime 1.0e6 # Output timesteps (finer timesteps will take longer) [sUnitTime] \"\"\" # Star input file template body_file = \"\"\"# sName star # body name saModules stellar # VPLanet module(s) used sStellarModel baraffe # stellar model grid (currently only baraffe+2015 grids) dMass 1.0 # stellar mass [sUnitMass] dAge 5e6 # age at which stellar grids are initialized (age we assume star has formed) [sUnitTime] dSatXUVFrac 1.0e-3 # fsat = initial Lxuv / Lbol [dimensionless ratio] dSatXUVTime 1.0e8 # tsat = saturation time [sUnitTime] dXUVBeta 1.0 # beta = exponential decay rate [dimensionless] # output evolution parameters saOutputOrder Time Luminosity Radius Temperature LXUVTot \"\"\" . We can now execute this model as before, and plot our new output variable: . # Create subdirectory stellar/baraffe to save this example example_baraffe_ribas = os.path.join(temp_dir, \"stellar/baraffe_ribas\") if not os.path.exists(example_baraffe_ribas): os.makedirs(example_baraffe_ribas) # Write vpl_file to vpl.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe_ribas, \"vpl.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(vpl_file, file=file) # Write body_file to star.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe_ribas, \"star.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(body_file, file=file) . subprocess.call(\"vplanet vpl.in\", cwd=example_baraffe_ribas, shell=True) . output = vplanet.get_output(example_baraffe_ribas) plt.plot(output.star[:][0], output.star[:][-1]) plt.ylabel(\"XUV Luminosity [Lsun]\") plt.xlabel(\"Time [yr]\") plt.xscale(\"log\") plt.yscale(\"log\") plt.show() . [Part B] say we also want to model the rotational evolution of our star according to gyrochrnology models. vplanet includes several implementations of magnetic braking laws which govern the rotational evolution of the star: . | Reiners &amp; Mohanty [2012] | Repetto &amp; Nelemans [2014] | Matt et al. [2015] | . To add a magnetic braking model to our simulation we will add the following inputs: . sMagBrakingModel dRotPeriod . where the variable sMagBrakingModel specifies which magnetic braking model to use (options: matt, reiners, skumanich), and the variable dRotPeriod specifies the initial condition rotation period of the star. In this example we’ll set the initial rotation period to 10 days (or 0.027378508 years since that’s the unit we’ve set for sUnitTime). We will also add the output variable . RotPer . so that we can track the rotation period evolution. # System input file template vpl_file = \"\"\"# sSystemName system iVerbose 0 # Verbosity level bOverwrite 1 # Allow file overwrites? saBodyFiles star.in # list infile names of all body files bDoLog 1 # Write a log file? iDigits 6 # Maximum number of digits to right of decimal dMinValue 1e-10 # Minimum value of eccentricity/obliquity bDoForward 1 # Perform a forward evolution? bVarDt 1 # Use variable timestepping? dEta 0.01 # Coefficient for variable timestepping # Input/Output Units # Units specified in the primary input file are propagated into the bodies sUnitMass solar # Options: gram, kg, Earth, Neptune, Jupiter, solar sUnitLength m # Options: cm, m, km, Earth, Jupiter, solar, AU sUnitTime year # Options: sec, day, year, Myr, Gyr sUnitAngle deg # Options: deg, rad dStopTime 1.0e9 # Final age which the system will be evolved to [sUnitTime] dOutputTime 1.0e6 # Output timesteps (finer timesteps will take longer) [sUnitTime] \"\"\" # Star input file template body_file = \"\"\"# sName star # body name saModules stellar # VPLanet module(s) used sStellarModel baraffe # stellar model grid (currently only baraffe+2015 grids) sMagBrakingModel matt # magnetic braking model (opt: matt, reiners, skumanich) dMass 1.0 # stellar mass [sUnitMass] dAge 5e6 # age at which stellar grids are initialized (age we assume star has formed) [sUnitTime] dSatXUVFrac 1.0e-3 # fsat = initial Lxuv / Lbol [dimensionless ratio] dSatXUVTime 1.0e8 # tsat = saturation time [sUnitTime] dXUVBeta 1.0 # beta = exponential decay rate [dimensionless] dRotPeriod 0.027378508 # initial rotation period [sUnitTime] # output evolution parameters saOutputOrder Time Luminosity Radius Temperature LXUVTot RotPer \"\"\" . # Create subdirectory stellar/baraffe to save this example example_baraffe_ribas_matt = os.path.join(temp_dir, \"stellar/baraffe_ribas_matt\") if not os.path.exists(example_baraffe_ribas_matt): os.makedirs(example_baraffe_ribas_matt) # Write vpl_file to vpl.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe_ribas_matt, \"vpl.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(vpl_file, file=file) # Write body_file to star.in with open(os.path.join(example_baraffe_ribas_matt, \"star.in\"), \"w\") as file: print(body_file, file=file) . subprocess.call(\"vplanet vpl.in\", cwd=example_baraffe_ribas_matt, shell=True) . output = vplanet.get_output(example_baraffe_ribas_matt) sim_time = output.star[:][0].to(u.yr) sim_prot = output.star[:][-1].to(u.day) plt.plot(sim_time, sim_prot) plt.ylabel(\"Rotation Period [days]\") plt.xlabel(\"Time [yr]\") plt.xscale(\"log\") plt.show() . 4. Varying simulation parameters (manually) . Repeat step 3, this time experimenting with different values of input parameters: . dMass dAge dSatXUVFrac dSatXUVTime dXUVBeta dRotPeriod . Also see what output parameters you can add to saOutputOrder. For a description of available output options for each vplanet model, see the documentation here. You can also open up the log file for one of the simulations we’ve run, which should show a list of variables like this. For example, the file infile_templates/stellar/baraffe_ribas/system.log should contain a list that looks something like this: . ---- FINAL SYSTEM PROPERTIES ---- (Age) System Age [sec]: 3.171539e+16 (Time) Simulation Time [sec]: 3.155760e+16 (TotAngMom) Total Angular Momentum [kg*m^2/sec]: 2.906215e+43 (TotEnergy) Total System Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: -1.576439e+41 (PotEnergy) Body's non-orbital Potential Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: -2.465543e+41 (KinEnergy) Body's non-orbital Kinetic Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: 2.374104e+35 (DeltaTime) Average Timestep Over Last Output Interval [sec]: 2.979043e+08 ----- BODY: star ---- Active Modules: STELLAR Module Bit Sum: 65 Color: 000000 (Mass) Mass [kg]: 1.988416e+30 (Radius) Radius [m]: 6.421812e+08 (RadGyra) Radius of Gyration/Moment of Inertia Constant []: 0.290802 (RotAngMom) Rotational Angular Momentum [kg*m^2/sec]: 1.814568e+41 (RotVel) Rotational Velocity [m/sec]: 1680.405360 (BodyType) Type of Body (0 == planet) []: 0.000000 (RotRate) Rotational Frequency [/sec]: 2.616715e-06 (RotPer) Rotational Period [sec]: 2.401173e+06 (Density) Average Density [kg/m^3]: 1792.445051 (HZLimitDryRunaway) Semi-major axis of Dry Runaway HZ Limit [m]: 1.175737e+11 (HZLimRecVenus) Recent Venus HZ Limit [m]: 9.761750e+10 (HZLimRunaway) Runaway Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 1.279327e+11 (HZLimMoistGreenhouse) Moist Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 1.291631e+11 (HZLimMaxGreenhouse) Maximum Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 2.207654e+11 (HZLimEarlyMars) Early Mars HZ Limit [m]: 2.408656e+11 (Instellation) Orbit-averaged INcident STELLar radiATION [kg*m^2/sec^2/(m^2*sec)]: -1.000000 (CriticalSemiMajorAxis) Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999) P-type Critical Semi-major Axis [m]: -1.000000 (LXUVTot) Total XUV Luminosity [kg*m^2/sec^2/(m^2*sec)]: 2.869274e+22 (LostEnergy) Body's Total Lost Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: 8.891018e+40 (LostAngMom) Lost Angular Momentum due to Magnetic Braking [kg*m^2/sec]: 2.888069e+43 ----- STELLAR PARAMETERS (star)------ (Luminosity) Luminosity [kg*m^2/sec^3]: 2.883620e+26 (LXUVStellar) Base X-ray/XUV Luminosity [kg*m^2/sec^3]: 2.869274e+22 (Temperature) Effective Temperature [K]: 5591.929944 (LXUVFrac) Fraction of luminosity in XUV []: 9.950249e-05 (RossbyNumber) Rossby Number []: 1.774299 (DRotPerDtStellar) Time Rate of Change of Rotation Period in STELLAR []: 2.092177e-11 Output Order: Time[year] Luminosity[Msun*m^2/year^3] Radius[m] Temperature[K] LXUVTot[Msun*m^2/year^2/(m^2*year)] Grid Output Order: .

Varying simulation parameters with vplanet_inference . As you likely noticed working through the first tutorial 1_introduction_to_stellar, it gets tedious to manually create new infiles for each new simulation you want to run and keep track of the proper unit conversions for each variable. While this workflow is okay for running just one or a few models, it is unsuitable if we want to say, run thousands of simulations to explore a parameter space, or do any inference to quantify parameter uncertainties. Fortunately this is where the package vplanet_inference comes in handy! . import vplanet_inference as vpi . vplanet_inference requires that we have a set of template infiles saved somewhere. We will call the directory containing the infiles the inpath. It also requires that we specify an outpath directory where infiles will be copied from inpath and written with the substituted parameters that we specify. # Specify the directory to read infile templates from inpath = \"infile_templates/stellar/baraffe_ribas/\" # Speficy the directory where infiles will be written to outpath = \"output/\" . We can choose which variables in the infiles that we want to vary by creating a dictionary called inparams. The dict keys follow the convention &lt;infile name&gt;.&lt;variable name&gt; and the dict values specify the units for the variables using astropy.units. # Dictionary of input parameters and units inparams = {\"star.dMass\": u.Msun, \"vpl.dStopTime\": u.Gyr} . Similarly we can also create a dictionary called outparams which tells vplanet_inference which variables to add to our saOutputOrder for each body. The dict keys follow the convention final.&lt;body name&gt;.&lt;variable name&gt;, and the dict values use astropy.units. # Dictionary of output parameters and units outparams = {\"final.star.Radius\": u.Rsun, \"final.star.Luminosity\": u.Lsun} . # Initialize the vplanet model vpm = vpi.VplanetModel(inparams=inparams, outparams=outparams, inpath=inpath, outpath=outpath, timesteps=1e6*u.yr, time_init=5e6*u.yr, verbose=True) . As an example, we’ll compute the evolution of a sun-like star. theta will be our array of values that we substitute in for the inparameters. These values should be the same order and units that we specified in our inparams dictionary. We can also optionally choose to save the written infiles to a specified outsubpath if we wish to inspect those later, such as for debugging. (If you run many simulations though, it is often better to say remove=True which deletes the infiles after the results are read. This will save you disk space.) . # Run the vplanet model theta = np.array([1.0, 9.0]) evol = vpm.run_model(theta, remove=False, outsubpath=\"solar_evol\") . plt.figure(figsize=[8,6]) plt.plot(evol[\"Time\"], evol[\"final.star.Luminosity\"]) plt.xscale(\"log\") plt.yscale(\"log\") plt.show() . 2.

    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out?

The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop.

    "content": "1. Fork the repo . Navigate to https://github.com/jbirky/yupra on your browser. In the upper right corner, select the Fork button: . Choose yourself as the owner for the forked repo and check “copy main branch only”: . (Note: Step 1 only needs to be done once.) . 2. Clone repo to local computer . Now we want to clone our fork of the repository onto our local machine. We can put this in the same research/ directory as our other files. To do this, change directories to your research/ folder: . cd ~/research . Within the research directory, download the repo by using the clone command (and replacing jbirky in the url with your own github username): . git clone https://github.com/jbirky/yupra . If you type ls, you should now see all of the packages we’ve downloaded plus the yupra repo: . /research /alabi /vplanet /vplanet_inference /yupra ... Now we’ll create a new folder within the yupra project to store our code and results. To do this, navigate to yupra directory and create a new folder with your name: . cd yupra mkdir jbirky . This is the folder where you’ll add all the code that you write (note: you only need to create this folder once). 3. Commit and push changes results to your fork . Copy the tutorial files to your personal folder: . cp -r tutorials/ jbirky/tutorials . Now if you type git status you can check that git has tracked that new files have been added or modified, and the status command should show something like: . Untracked files: (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed) jbirky/ . For more detailed instructions see here: . | How to fork a repo . | How to update your fork . | . ",
