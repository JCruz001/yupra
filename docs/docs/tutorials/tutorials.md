# Tutorials
{: .no_toc }


1. Introduction to `vplanet` 
- how to configure and run simulations by command line
- run `makeplot` and reproduce examples in the `vplanet` docs
- run stellar evolution model in python

2. Parameter sweeps 
- run parameter sweeps in python using `vplanet_inference`

3. Statistics I
- first exercise: given data from trappist 1, tweak the model parameters by hand to fit the data - how do we do this robustly while estimating the uncertainty?
- introduce bayesian statistics (theory)

4. Statistics II
- introduction to markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) methods
- example: fitting a line to data using `emcee`

5. Statistics III
- introduction to `alabi` 
- reproduce some examples in the `alabi` docs
- reproduce trappist 1 analysis with `alabi`

6. Analyzing new systems
- modify trappist 1 example given data for a different star with xuv measurements
- compute posteriors using `alabi`

7. Model comparison
- compare Ribas 2015 and Johnstone 2021 xuv models

8. Interpreting results
- discuss what we notice for each system 
- which model seems to reproduce the observations the best?
- what trends do we notice when comparing stars in the sample with different masses?

9. Presentations
- finish up plots and prepare presentations for the symposium
- practice presentations (during group meeting?)
